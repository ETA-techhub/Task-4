# 🔍 Task 4: Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

## ✅ Objective
Train a logistic regression model to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, confusion_matrix, ROC-AUC, classification_report)

## 🔍 Steps Followed
1. Loaded the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
2. Standardized features and split into train/test sets.
3. Trained logistic regression model.
4. Evaluated performance using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC Score
5. Visualized:
   - ROC Curve
   - Sigmoid Function

## 📈 Output
- Model accuracy and classification report.
- ROC curve and AUC score.
- Sigmoid curve for threshold understanding.
